Pytest Coverage Hook Plugin for PP Security-Master

Automatically detects when tests are run with coverage and triggers
enhanced coverage report generation. Integrates with VS Code workflow.

Features:
- Auto-detects coverage runs via pytest hooks
- Triggers enhanced report generation after test completion
- Works with CLI and VS Code test execution
- Handles security-master specific test types
