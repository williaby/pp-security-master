# Security Master Service - Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Version**: 1.1  
**Date**: 2025-08-23  
**Target Release**: Phase 0-3 (10.5 weeks) - *Updated for project planning refinements*  

> **Related Documents**: [Complete Project Plan](PROJECT_PLAN.md) | [Architecture Decisions](docs/adr/) | [Setup Guide](README.md)

## Executive Summary

The MVP delivers **core data sovereignty** for Portfolio Performance users by enabling complete backup generation and institution transaction import. This establishes the foundation for advanced classification and validation features in subsequent releases.

**MVP Value Proposition**: Transform Portfolio Performance from a desktop-only tool into a database-backed system with enterprise-grade backup capabilities and institution data integration.

**Architecture Foundation**: Built on [transaction-centric architecture](docs/adr/ADR-001-transaction-centric-architecture.md) with [complete PP backup restoration capability](docs/adr/ADR-002-portfolio-performance-backup-restoration.md) and [four-tier data sourcing hierarchy](docs/adr/ADR-003-securities-master-data-sourcing-hierarchy.md).
