# ADR-012: Data Quality Reporting and Reconciliation Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Maintaining high data quality is vital for Portfolio Performance (PP) Security Master operations. The system needs comprehensive reporting capabilities to identify data quality gaps, prevent data duplication, enable position reconciliation, and generate standardized client reports. As the system scales and adds quantitative analysis capabilities, robust reporting infrastructure becomes essential for operational excellence and client service.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive data quality reporting and reconciliation framework with five core reporting capabilities:

### 1. Security Master Data Quality Reporting
- **Gap Identification**: Reports highlighting securities missing classifications, pricing, or complete metadata
- **Manual Assignment Tracking**: Dashboard for positions requiring manual category assignment
- **Pricing Staleness**: Quarterly alerts for securities needing price updates
- **Data Completeness Metrics**: Coverage percentages by asset class and data source

### 2. Transaction Deduplication Detection
- **Duplicate Transaction Reports**: Automated detection of potential duplicates during import
- **Fuzzy Matching Algorithms**: Identify near-duplicates with slight variations in dates, amounts, or descriptions
- **Manual Review Queue**: Workflow for reviewing and resolving detected duplicates
- **Import Audit Trail**: Complete history of transaction imports with deduplication statistics

### 3. Point-in-Time Position Reconciliation
- **Kubera Report Reconciliation**: Compare current PP positions to external Kubera reports
- **Broker Statement Reconciliation**: Monthly, quarterly, and annual statement validation against account positions
- **Position Variance Reporting**: Identify and track discrepancies with tolerance thresholds
- **Reconciliation Dashboard**: Visual representation of reconciliation status across all accounts

### 4. Portfolio Analysis Report Export
- **Quantitative Metrics Export**: Risk metrics, performance attribution, sector allocation
- **Custom Report Builder**: Flexible reporting engine for ad-hoc analysis
- **Standardized Formats**: Excel, PDF, and JSON export capabilities
- **Historical Trending**: Period-over-period analysis and trending reports

### 5. Standardized Quarterly Client Reporting
- **Consolidated Account View**: 1-2 page summary covering all client accounts
- **Key Performance Indicators**: Returns, risk metrics, allocation summaries
- **Quantitative Insights**: Automated commentary on portfolio performance and positioning
- **Customizable Templates**: Brand-consistent templates adaptable per client requirements

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Architecture

├── data_quality/       # Security master gap analysis and metrics
├── reconciliation/     # Position and transaction reconciliation
├── deduplication/      # Transaction duplicate detection
├── analytics/          # Portfolio analysis and export
├── client_reports/     # Standardized quarterly reporting
└── dashboard/          # Web-based reporting interface
```

### Database Schema Extensions
- **reporting_metrics**: Store calculated data quality metrics
- **reconciliation_runs**: Track reconciliation execution and results
- **duplicate_candidates**: Store potential duplicate transactions for review
- **client_report_configs**: Customizable client reporting templates

### Reporting Engine Components
1. **Scheduled Jobs**: Automated daily/weekly data quality checks
2. **Alert System**: Email/dashboard notifications for critical data gaps
3. **Export Pipeline**: Standardized report generation and distribution
4. **API Endpoints**: RESTful access to reporting data for external systems

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Operational Excellence**: Proactive identification of data quality issues
- **Client Confidence**: Professional, standardized reporting builds trust
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Comprehensive audit trail and reconciliation capabilities
- **Scalability**: Automated reporting reduces manual oversight as accounts grow
- **Data Integrity**: Multiple validation layers ensure position accuracy

### Challenges
- **Implementation Complexity**: Five distinct reporting domains require significant development
- **Performance Impact**: Regular reconciliation and quality checks may affect system performance
- **Storage Requirements**: Historical reconciliation data and report archives increase storage needs
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Report templates and reconciliation rules require ongoing maintenance

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Security master data quality reporting (immediate operational need)
2. **Phase 2**: Transaction deduplication detection (prevents data corruption)
3. **Phase 3**: Position reconciliation capabilities (builds client confidence)
4. **Phase 4**: Portfolio analysis exports (enables advanced analytics)
5. **Phase 5**: Standardized client reporting (professional client service)

## Success Metrics

- **Data Quality**: >95% security master completeness within 30 days
- **Reconciliation Accuracy**: <0.01% position variance tolerance
- **Client Satisfaction**: Quarterly report delivery within 5 business days of period end
- **Operational Efficiency**: <2 hours weekly manual data quality review
- **System Performance**: Report generation <30 seconds for standard templates
