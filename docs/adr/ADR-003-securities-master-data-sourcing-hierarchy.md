# ADR-003: Securities Master Data Sourcing Hierarchy

**Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Byron, Development Team  
**Consulted**: Portfolio Performance API Documentation, pp-portfolio-classifier Analysis  
**Informed**: Data Quality Team, Classification Engine Team  

## Context

The Securities Master Service requires comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date security reference data to support classification, taxonomy assignment, and Portfolio Performance integration. Multiple data sources are available with varying levels of reliability, cost, coverage, and maintenance requirements.

The challenge is establishing a clear hierarchy that maximizes data quality while minimizing operational complexity and external dependencies. We need a systematic approach that leverages existing Portfolio Performance capabilities first, then supplements with progressively more specialized sources.

## Decision

We will implement a **four-tier hierarchical data sourcing strategy** for securities master data, proceeding from most reliable/native sources to manual processes as needed.

### Tier 1: Portfolio Performance Native APIs and Feeds

**Priority**: Highest (Tier 1)  
**Rationale**: Leverage existing, maintained data sources that PP users already rely on  
**Maintenance**: Zero additional overhead - PP team maintains these sources  

#### **1.1 Portfolio Performance Built-in Quote Providers**

- **Yahoo Finance Integration**: PP's primary price and basic data source
- **Portfolio Performance Historical Data**: Existing price feeds and basic security metadata

## Implementation Strategy

### Data Source Cascade Logic

```python
def classify_security(security_identifier):
    """
    Hierarchical classification with fallback logic
    """
    # Tier 1: PP Native Sources
    classification = query_pp_native_sources(security_identifier)
    if classification.is_complete():
        return classification.mark_source("pp_native")
    
    # Tier 2: pp-portfolio-classifier and BlackRock Holdings
    if security.is_fund_or_etf():
        classification = pp_portfolio_classifier.classify(security_identifier)
        if classification.is_complete():
            return classification.mark_source("pp_classifier")
    
    # Tier 2: BlackRock Quarterly Holdings (for iShares ETFs)
    if security.is_ishares_etf():
        classification = blackrock_holdings_parser.classify(security_identifier)
        if classification.is_complete():
            return classification.mark_source("blackrock_holdings")
    
    # Tier 3: Custom APIs
    classification = query_external_apis(security_identifier)
    if classification.is_complete():
        return classification.mark_source("external_api")
    
    # Tier 4: Manual Process
    return queue_for_manual_classification(security_identifier)
```
