# ADR-010: Performance Testing Strategy

**Date**: 2025-08-23  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Byron, Development Team  
**Consulted**: Database Performance Team, Production Operations  
**Informed**: QA Team, Executive Stakeholders  

## Context

The Security Master Service handles large volumes of financial data including:

- High-frequency transaction processing from multiple institutions
- Real-time security classification with external API calls
- Complex analytics calculations on portfolio datasets
- Large-scale Portfolio Performance XML import/export operations

Performance requirements identified from project planning review:

- **Classification API Response**: <2s p95 for classification requests
- **Large Portfolio Processing**: Complete backup for 10,000+ transactions within 30 seconds  
- **Migration Performance**: Migration completes within 2 hours for large portfolios
- **Concurrent User Support**: Support multiple simultaneous classification operations

Without comprehensive performance testing, the system risks:

- Poor user experience with slow classification responses
- System failures under production load
- Scalability limitations as portfolio sizes grow
- Database performance degradation over time

## Decision

We will implement a **comprehensive, multi-layered performance testing strategy** that validates system performance at unit, integration, and system levels throughout the development lifecycle.

### Performance Testing Architecture

#### **Four-Tier Testing Strategy**

```python
Unit Performance Tests    → Individual function/class performance
Component Performance     → Database operations, API calls, file processing  
Integration Performance   → End-to-end workflow performance
Load/Stress Testing      → System behavior under production-like conditions
```

#### **Performance Testing Tools & Framework**

```python
# Core Performance Testing Framework
class PerformanceTestSuite:
    """Comprehensive performance testing for Security Master Service"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics_collector = MetricsCollector()
        self.load_generator = LoadGenerator()
        self.database_profiler = DatabaseProfiler()
    
    def run_classification_performance_test(self, securities_count: int) -> PerformanceReport:
        """Test classification engine performance with varying loads"""
        pass
    
    def run_database_performance_test(self, transaction_count: int) -> DatabaseReport:
        """Test database performance with large transaction datasets"""
        pass
    
    def run_api_performance_test(self, concurrent_requests: int) -> APIReport:
        """Test external API integration performance under load"""
        pass
```

## Performance Testing Strategy

### Tier 1: Unit Performance Testing

**Objectives**: Validate individual component performance and identify bottlenecks

#### **Critical Components for Unit Performance Testing**

           # Test individual fund classification speed
           pass
       
       @performance_test(max_duration=0.2, memory_limit="50MB")  
       def test_equity_classification_performance(self):
           # Test individual equity classification speed
           pass
   ```

       # Load portfolio with 100,000+ transactions
       # Monitor memory usage during processing
       # Validate memory cleanup after operations
       pass
   ```

3. **API Rate Limit Stress Testing**
